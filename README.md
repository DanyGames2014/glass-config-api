# Glass Config API for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 Client

## Description

Think a far more simple version of [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) for beta 1.7.3.

This follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) summary, which means any mods made with 1.x.x will work with any version of GCAPI that is equal or higher than the version said mod was made with, and 2.x.x will require 1.x.x mods to update. 

## Installation

[See the Minecraft Cursed Legacy Website.](https://minecraft-cursed-legacy.github.io/)  
Optional requirement, though heavily recommended as like 90% of GCAPI's user-facing functionality uses this: [ModMenu](https://github.com/calmilamsy/ModMenu).  

## Usage Inside a Mod

See the [wiki](https://github.com/calmilamsy/glass-config-api/wiki).
